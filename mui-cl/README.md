ClubLabs is utilizing our newest Design System based on React. The amazing design is inspired by Material Design and contains all the components you need for your development. 

During the development of this dashboard, we have used many existing resources from awesome developers. We want to thank them for providing their tools open source:

- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - The React UI library for faster and easier web development.
- [React Flatpickr](https://github.com/haoxins/react-flatpickr) - Useful library used to select date.
- [React Copy to Clipboard](https://github.com/nkbt/react-copy-to-clipboard) - Useful library used for copying data to the clipboard.
- [React Countup](https://github.com/glennreyes/react-countup) - A lightweight React component that can be used to quickly create animations that display numerical data in a more interesting way.
- [React Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter) - Syntax highlighting component for react with prismjs or highlightjs ast using inline styles.
- [ChromaJS](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) - A small-ish zero-dependency JavaScript library for all kinds of color conversions and color scales.
